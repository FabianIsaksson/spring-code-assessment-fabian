# Code test instructions

Build an application that fetches public playlists via an API from YouTube, Spotify or SoundCloud, present the content and create features that lets the user add their favourites to their own list. A good example of UI for this could be https://screenlane.com/screen/breethe-ios-app-05c-1/, but feel free to present it in which ever way you like.

The choice of technologies to solve this are up to you. How would you have solved this if the brief from a client was to use technology that was the best fit for this problem?
